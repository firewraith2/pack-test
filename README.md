# 📦 Pack Explorer

**Pack Explorer** is a GUI tool for browsing and modifying pack files in _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky_.

Pack files (.bin) are containers used by the game to bundle multiple assets together—such as sprites, effects, dungeon data, and more. This tool lets you open these containers, view their contents, and easily import or export entries.

Known pack files:

-   EFFECT/effect.bin
-   DUNGEON/dungeon.bin
-   MONSTER/monster.bin
-   MONSTER/m_attack.bin
-   MONSTER/m_ground.bin
-   BALANCE/m_level.bin

**Note:** The game may contain additional pack files not listed here.

-   **`bin_pack/model.py`** - Pack parsing/serialization logic based on `skytemple_files.container.bin_pack`
-   **`bin_pack/file_types.py`** - File type detection logic derived from skytemple-files file format handlers (BGP, DPL, SCREEN, AT4PX, etc.)

Special thanks to:
